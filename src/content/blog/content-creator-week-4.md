## Content Creator's Log, Stardate: 2024.10.21. The mission to grow a YouTube channel continues... I got some views.

I've now published 6 videos and set a new record: 38 views on my latest video. 
Views were dropping off, with the last one getting only 6, but things might pick up.

Here are some stats from YouTube Studio:

In terms of video editing improvements, I learned to add pattern interrupts, 
which I read about in Brian Dean's blog, [backlinko.com](https://www.backlinko.com)

Brian actually abandoned his channel because he found recording videos tedious. 
I think that's the toughest part of making videos, and I get where he's coming from.

I've also managed to create some basic animations in Kdenlive, 
which are essential for a faceless channel.

And I've included basic visual explanations.

That's all for now.
