From what I've seen:  \n- Hooks should be **under 30 words**.  \n- The **first 5 seconds** are the most important.  \n\nFor my latest video, I wrote this hook:  \n\n> *Want to write clean React code that even the coding gods would approve of?

Instead of typing code live, I **delete lines and undo** them one by one.  \n   - This avoids mistakes while recording.  \n   - When I used to write everything from scratch, I kept messing up and had to **redo the screen recording constantly**.  \n\nI learned this from Jeff Delaney, the creator of Fireship—he made a YouTube tutorial about it.\n\n### Final Thoughts 💡  \nI've improved, but I still have **a long way to go**.

Here's why:\n\n## 1. Clean and Consistent Data Structure\n\nHere's the deal: When you're pulling data from an API, it's not always in the format you need.\n\nSometimes, APIs return bloated, nested objects with way more information than you care about. \n\nThat's where mapping comes in. \n\nFor instance, let's look at some user data from [https://fakestoreapi.com/](https://fakestoreapi.com/)\n\nWe are gonna get some user data, but mapped it in a way that some of the user data gets lefted out.\n\nWhen you hit this endpoint https://fakestoreapi.com/users you get a list of users with all sorts of info. \nHere's an example of one user object:\n\n```js showLineNumbers\n[\n   {\n      \"address\": {\n         \"geolocation\": {\n            \"lat\": \"-37.3159\",\n            \"long\": \"81.1496\"\n         },\n         \"city\": \"kilcoole\",\n         \"street\": \"new road\",\n         \"number\": 7682,\n         \"zipcode\": \"12926-3874\"\n      },\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"email\": \"john@gmail.com\",\n      \"username\": \"johnd\",\n      \"password\": \"m38rmF$\",\n      \"name\": {\n         \"firstname\": \"john\",\n         \"lastname\": \"doe\"\n      },\n      \"phone\": \"1-570-236-7033\",\n      \"__v\": 0\n   }\n]\n```\n\nLet's define the type of the user\n\n```js showLineNumbers\ntype User = {\n  address: {\n    city: string;\n    street: string;\n    number: number;\n    zipcode: string;\n  };\n  id: number;\n  email: string;\n  username: string;\n  name: {\n    firstname: string;\n    lastname: string;\n  };\n  phone: string;\n};\n```\n\nAnd this is the type for the filtered user. ***USE TYPESCRIPT*** 👈\n\n```js showLineNumbers\ntype FilteredUser = {\n  id: string;\n  email: string;\n  username: string;\n  name: {\n    firstname: string;\n    lastname: string;\n  };\n  address: {\n    city: string;\n    street: string;\n    zipcode: string;\n  };\n};\n```\n\nThis is the function for mapping the user data\n\n```js showLineNumbers\n// Function to filter out unwanted fields\nfunction filterUserData(users: User[]): FilteredUser[] {\n  return users.map(({ id, email, username, name, address }) => ({\n    id: '' + id, // number to string\n    email,\n    username,\n    name: {\n      firstname: name.firstname,\n      lastname: name.lastname,\n    },\n    address: {\n      city: address.city,\n      street: address.street,\n      zipcode: address.zipcode,\n    },\n  }));\n}\n```\n\n## 2. Decoupling\n\nSometimes, APIs change.\n\nWhen that happens, do you want to rewrite your entire app? Nope.\n\nWith mapped data, you're decoupling your app from the API. \n\nIf the API response changes, you just tweak your mapping logic instead of ripping apart \nyour whole codebase.\n\n**Save yourself from a world of pain.**\n\n![You are entering a world of pain - Walter - The big lebowsky](/blog/03/world-of-pain-walter-min.png)\n\nIf the API changes its response structure or fields, you can adjust the mapping \nlogic rather than **refactoring the entire app**.\n\n## 3. Performance\n\nMore data = more problems. \n\nBy mapping your data, you cut down on the size of the payload you're passing around. \n\nThis boosts performance and makes your app faster.\n\nInstead of dragging around unnecessary fields, just map what you need.\n\n## 4. Error Handling: Catch Errors Before They Wreak Havoc\n\nWhen mapping, you can intercept missing fields or errors in the API response. \n\nThat way, you can fix them before they break your app and ruin the user experience.","src/content/blog/mapping-api-data.md","191d9996af1676fa",{"html":84,"metadata":85},"\u003Cp>Mapping data from an API is an essential step for several reasons,\nespecially when you’re dealing with web development and interacting\nwith third-party services.

A Markdown-formatted\ndocument should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking\nlike it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While\nMarkdown's syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML\nfilters -- including [Setext](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/mirror/setext.html), [atx](http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/atx/), [Textile](http://textism.com/tools/textile/), [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html),\n[Grutatext](http://www.triptico.com/software/grutatxt.html), and [EtText](http://ettext.taint.org/doc/) -- the single biggest source of\ninspiration for Markdown's syntax is the format of plain text email.\n\n## Block Elements\n\n### Paragraphs and Line Breaks\n\nA paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated\nby one or more blank lines. (A blank line is any line that looks like a\nblank line -- a line containing nothing but spaces or tabs is considered\nblank.) Normal paragraphs should not be indented with spaces or tabs.\n\nThe implication of the \"one or more consecutive lines of text\" rule is\nthat Markdown supports \"hard-wrapped\" text paragraphs. This differs\nsignificantly from most other text-to-HTML formatters (including Movable\nType's \"Convert Line Breaks\" option) which translate every line break\ncharacter in a paragraph into a `\u003Cbr />` tag.\n\nWhen you *do* want to insert a `\u003Cbr />` break tag using Markdown, you\nend a line with two or more spaces, then type return.\n\n### Headers\n\nMarkdown supports two styles of headers, [Setext] [1] and [atx] [2].\n\nOptionally, you may \"close\" atx-style headers. This is purely\ncosmetic -- you can use this if you think it looks better. The\nclosing hashes don't even need to match the number of hashes\nused to open the header. (The number of opening hashes\ndetermines the header level.)\n\n\n### Blockquotes\n\nMarkdown uses email-style `>` characters for blockquoting. If you're\nfamiliar with quoting passages of text in an email message, then you\nknow how to create a blockquote in Markdown. It looks best if you hard\nwrap the text and put a `>` before every line:\n\n> This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,\n> consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus.\n> Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.\n> \n> Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisse\n> id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.\n\nMarkdown allows you to be lazy and only put the `>` before the first\nline of a hard-wrapped paragraph:\n\n> This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,\nconsectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus.\nVestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.\n\n> Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisse\nid sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.\n\nBlockquotes can be nested (i.e. a blockquote-in-a-blockquote) by\nadding additional levels of `>`:\n\n> This is the first level of quoting.\n>\n> > This is nested blockquote.\n>\n> Back to the first level.\n\nBlockquotes can contain other Markdown elements, including headers, lists,\nand code blocks:\n\n> ## This is a header.\n> \n> 1.   This is the first list item.\n> 2.   This is the second list item.\n> \n> Here's some example code:\n> \n>     return shell_exec(\"echo $input | $markdown_script\");\n\nAny decent text editor should make email-style quoting easy. For\nexample, with BBEdit, you can make a selection and choose Increase\nQuote Level from the Text menu.\n\n\n### Lists\n\nMarkdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.\n\nUnordered lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens -- interchangably\n-- as list markers:\n\n*   Red\n*   Green\n*   Blue\n\nis equivalent to:\n\n+   Red\n+   Green\n+   Blue\n\nand:\n\n-   Red\n-   Green\n-   Blue\n\nOrdered lists use numbers followed by periods:\n\n1.  Bird\n2.  McHale\n3.  Parish\n\nIt's important to note that the actual numbers you use to mark the\nlist have no effect on the HTML output Markdown produces. The HTML\nMarkdown produces from the above list is:\n\nIf you instead wrote the list in Markdown like this:\n\n1.  Bird\n1.  McHale\n1.  Parish\n\nor even:\n\n3. Bird\n1. McHale\n8. Parish\n\nyou'd get the exact same HTML output. The point is, if you want to,\nyou can use ordinal numbers in your ordered Markdown lists, so that\nthe numbers in your source match the numbers in your published HTML.\nBut if you want to be lazy, you don't have to.\n\nTo make lists look nice, you can wrap items with hanging indents:\n\n*   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.\n    Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,\n    viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.\n*   Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.\n    Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.\n\nBut if you want to be lazy, you don't have to:\n\n*   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.\nAliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,\nviverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.\n*   Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.\nSuspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.\n\nList items may consist of multiple paragraphs. Each subsequent\nparagraph in a list item must be indented by either 4 spaces\nor one tab:\n\n1.  This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor\n    sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit\n    mi posuere lectus.\n\n    Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet\n    vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum\n    sit amet velit.\n\n2.  Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.\n\nIt looks nice if you indent every line of the subsequent\nparagraphs, but here again, Markdown will allow you to be\nlazy:\n\n*   This is a list item with two paragraphs.\n\n    This is the second paragraph in the list item. You're\nonly required to indent the first line. Lorem ipsum dolor\nsit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.\n\n*   Another item in the same list.\n\nTo put a blockquote within a list item, the blockquote's `>`\ndelimiters need to be indented:\n\n*   A list item with a blockquote:\n\n    > This is a blockquote\n    > inside a list item.\n\nTo put a code block within a list item, the code block needs\nto be indented *twice* -- 8 spaces or two tabs:\n\n### Code Blocks\n\nPre-formatted code blocks are used for writing about programming or\nmarkup source code. Rather than forming normal paragraphs, the lines\nof a code block are interpreted literally. Markdown wraps a code block\nin both `\u003Cpre>` and `\u003Ccode>` tags.\n\nTo produce a code block in Markdown, simply indent every line of the\nblock by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab.\n\nThis is a normal paragraph:\n\n    This is a code block.\n\nHere is an example of AppleScript:\n\n    tell application \"Foo\"\n        beep\n    end tell\n\nA code block continues until it reaches a line that is not indented\n(or the end of the article).\n\nWithin a code block, ampersands (`&`) and angle brackets (`\u003C` and `>`)\nare automatically converted into HTML entities. This makes it very\neasy to include example HTML source code using Markdown -- just paste\nit and indent it, and Markdown will handle the hassle of encoding the\nampersands and angle brackets. For example, this:\n\n    \u003Cdiv class=\"footer\">\n        &copy; 2004 Foo Corporation\n    \u003C/div>\n\nRegular Markdown syntax is not processed within code blocks. E.g.,\nasterisks are just literal asterisks within a code block. This means\nit's also easy to use Markdown to write about Markdown's own syntax.\n\n```\ntell application \"Foo\"\n    beep\nend tell\n```\n\n## Span Elements\n\n### Links\n\nMarkdown supports two style of links: *inline* and *reference*.\n\nIn both styles, the link text is delimited by [square brackets].\n\nTo create an inline link, use a set of regular parentheses immediately\nafter the link text's closing square bracket. Inside the parentheses,\nput the URL where you want the link to point, along with an *optional*\ntitle for the link, surrounded in quotes. For example:\n\nThis is [an example](http://example.com/) inline link.\n\n[This link](http://example.net/) has no title attribute.\n\n### Emphasis\n\nMarkdown treats asterisks (`*`) and underscores (`_`) as indicators of\nemphasis. Text wrapped with one `*` or `_` will be wrapped with an\nHTML `\u003Cem>` tag; double `*`'s or `_`'s will be wrapped with an HTML\n`\u003Cstrong>` tag. E.g., this input:\n\n*single asterisks*\n\n_single underscores_\n\n**double asterisks**\n\n__double underscores__\n\n### Code\n\nTo indicate a span of code, wrap it with backtick quotes (`` ` ``).\nUnlike a pre-formatted code block, a code span indicates code within a\nnormal paragraph. For example:\n\nUse the `printf()` function.","src/content/blog/mdx.md","e54c8d753278db9f",{"html":114,"metadata":115},"\u003Ch1 id=\"markdown-syntax\">Markdown: Syntax\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#overview\">Overview\u003C/a>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#philosophy\">Philosophy\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#html\">Inline HTML\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#autoescape\">Automatic Escaping for Special Characters\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#block\">Block Elements\u003C/a>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#p\">Paragraphs and Line Breaks\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#header\">Headers\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#blockquote\">Blockquotes\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#list\">Lists\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#precode\">Code Blocks\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#hr\">Horizontal Rules\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#span\">Span Elements\u003C/a>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#link\">Links\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#em\">Emphasis\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#code\">Code\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#img\">Images\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#misc\">Miscellaneous\u003C/a>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#backslash\">Backslash Escapes\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#autolink\">Automatic Links\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Note:\u003C/strong> This document is itself written using Markdown; you\ncan \u003Ca href=\"/projects/markdown/syntax.text\">see the source for it by adding ‘.text’ to the URL\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"overview\">Overview\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"philosophy\">Philosophy\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Readability, however, is emphasized above all else.

In /src/page.tsx, we have the following code:\n\n```jsx\nimport FeedbackForm from \"@/components/feedback-form\";\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    \u003Csection className=\"h-screen w-full flex items-center justify-center bg-yellow-400\">\n      \u003Cdiv className=\"max-w-lg w-full p-6 shadow-md rounded-xl bg-white\">\n        \u003Ch1 className=\"text-2xl font-bold mb-4\">Feedback\u003C/h1>\n        \u003CFeedbackForm />\n      \u003C/div>\n    \u003C/section>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn the /src/components directory, create a new file named feedback-form.tsx:\n\n```jsx\n'use client'\n\nimport React, { useActionState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createFeedbackAction } from '@/actions/create-feedback-action';\nimport { FeedbackState } from '@/types';\nimport toast from 'react-hot-toast';\n\nconst initialState:FeedbackState = {\n  message: '',\n  success: false\n}\n \nfunction FeedbackForm() {\n  const [state, formAction, isPending] = useActionState(createFeedbackAction, initialState)\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!isPending && state?.message) {\n      if (state.success) {\n        toast.success(state.message, {\n          position: 'top-center',\n          duration: 4000,\n        });\n      } else {\n        toast.error(state.message, {\n          position: 'top-center',\n          duration: 4000,\n        });\n      }\n    }\n  }, [isPending, state.message, state.success]);\n\n  return (\n    \u003Cform action={formAction} className=\"space-y-4\">\n      \u003Cdiv className=\"form-control\">\n        \u003Clabel htmlFor=\"email\" className=\"label\">\n          \u003Cspan className=\"label-text\">Email\u003C/span>\n        \u003C/label>\n        \u003Cinput\n          id=\"email\"\n          name=\"email\"\n          type=\"email\"\n          defaultValue={state.formValues?.email || ''}\n          className={`input input-bordered w-full`}\n          minLength={4}\n          maxLength={50}\n        />\n        {state?.errors?.email && (\n          \u003Cspan className=\"text-red-500 text-sm mt-1\">\n            {state?.errors.email[0]}\n          \u003C/span>\n        )}\n      \u003C/div>\n\n      \u003Cdiv className=\"form-control mt-4\">\n        \u003Clabel htmlFor=\"text\" className=\"label\">\n          \u003Cspan className=\"label-text\">Message\u003C/span>\n        \u003C/label>\n        \u003Ctextarea\n          id=\"text\"\n          name=\"text\"\n          defaultValue={state.formValues?.text || ''}\n          rows={4}\n          className=\"textarea textarea-bordered w-full\"\n          minLength={4}\n          maxLength={1000}\n        >\u003C/textarea>\n        {state?.errors?.text && (\n          \u003Cspan className=\"text-red-500 text-sm mt-1\">\n            {state?.errors.text[0]}\n          \u003C/span>\n        )}\n      \u003C/div>\n      \u003Cbutton\n        className=\"btn btn-neutral w-full mt-4\"\n        disabled={isPending}\n      >\n        {isPending ? 'Sending...' : 'Send'}\n      \u003C/button>\n    \u003C/form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Form Component Breakdown: HTML Validation, useEffect, and useActionState\n\nHere’s a detailed look at how the FeedbackForm component manages form handling using HTML validation, useEffect, and useActionState.\n\nInitial State Definition\nThe initialState object sets the baseline for feedback messaging and success status:\n\n```jsx\nconst initialState:FeedbackState = {\n  message: '',\n  success: false\n}\n```\n\nForm State Management with useActionState\nThe useActionState hook manages the form's state and actions:\n\n```jsx\nconst [state, formAction, isPending] = useActionState(createFeedbackAction, initialState)\n```\n\nThis hook helps control the form submission process, tracking whether a submission is pending and updating the state accordingly.\n\nFeedback Display with useEffect\nThe useEffect hook monitors the isPending status and the state object to display success or error messages:\n\n```jsx\nuseEffect(() => {\n  if (!isPending && state?.message) {\n    if (state.success) {\n      toast.success(state.message, {\n        position: 'top-center',\n        duration: 4000,\n      });\n    } else {\n      toast.error(state.message, {\n        position: 'top-center',\n        duration: 4000,\n      });\n    }\n  }\n}, [isPending, state.message, state.success]);\n\nexport default FeedbackForm\n```\n\nThis ensures that users are notified of the outcome after form submission.\n\n### Input Fields with HTML Validation\nThe input fields incorporate basic HTML validation rules using attributes like minLength and maxLength\n\n```jsx\n\u003Cinput\n  id=\"email\"\n  name=\"email\"\n  type=\"email\"\n  defaultValue={state.formValues?.email || ''}\n  className=\"input input-bordered w-full\"\n  minLength={4}\n  maxLength={50}\n/>\n```\n\nThese attributes validate the inputs before the form is submitted.\n\nError Handling for Inputs\nErrors are displayed beneath each input field when validation fails:\n\n```jsx\n{state?.errors?.email && (\n  \u003Cspan className=\"text-red-500 text-sm mt-1\">\n    {state?.errors.email[0]}\n  \u003C/span>\n)}\n```\n\nThe component checks for errors in the state and renders them if present.\n\nSubmit Button Behavior\nThe submit button dynamically reflects the form’s pending state:\n\n```jsx\n\u003Cbutton\n  className=\"btn btn-neutral w-full mt-4\"\n  disabled={isPending}\n>\n  {isPending ? 'Sending...' : 'Send'}\n\u003C/button>\n```\n\nWhen the form is pending, the button displays “Sending…” to indicate the submission process.\n\nThis breakdown showcases how each part of the FeedbackForm component works together to create a smooth form handling experience, leveraging both client-side validation and feedback mechanisms.\n\n## sendFeedbackAction server action\n\nWithin the /src/actions directory, create a new file named send-feedback-action.ts:\n\n```jsx\n'use server'\n\nimport { z } from 'zod' \nimport { connectDB } from \"@/utils/connectDB\"\nimport { FeedbackData, FeedbackState } from '@/types'\nimport { getErrorMessage } from '@/utils/error'\nimport Feedback from \"@/models/feedback\";\n\nexport async function createFeedbackAction(prevState: FeedbackState, formData: FormData) {\n  const schema = z.object({\n    email: z\n      .string()\n      .email({ message: 'Invalid email format' })\n      .nonempty({ message: 'Email is required' })\n      .max(50, { message: 'Email should be at most 50 characters long' }),\n    text: z\n      .string()\n      .min(4, { message: 'Message should be at least 4 characters long' })\n      .nonempty({ message: 'Message is required' })\n      .max(1000, { message: 'Message should be at most 500 characters long' }),\n  })\n  \n  try {\n    const sourceData: FeedbackData = {\n      email: formData.get('email') as string,\n      text: formData.get('text') as string,\n    }\n\n    const validatedFields = schema.safeParse(sourceData);\n\n    if (!validatedFields.success) {\n      return {\n        success: false,\n        message: 'Invalid fields',\n        errors: validatedFields.error.flatten().fieldErrors,\n        formValues: sourceData\n      };\n    }\n    \n    await connectDB()\n\n    await Feedback.create(\n      validatedFields.data\n    )\n\n    return {\n      success: true, \n      message: 'New feedback created' \n    }\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Error sending feedback:\", getErrorMessage(error));\n    return {\n      success: false, \n      message: `We couldn't process your feedback. Please try again later.`\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### sendFeedbackAction Breakdown: Zod Schema Validation and Database Interaction\n\nThe createFeedbackAction function handles form validation and database interactions using Zod schemas and MongoDB.\n\nAs you can see, we extract the error message from the catch block and return a generic error message to the user.\n\ngetErrorMessage(error) is a utility function that extracts the error message from the error object.\n\nThis error is of type unknown by default, it can be a string or an object, so we need to check if it's an object and extract the message property.\n\n```jsx\nexport const getErrorMessage = (error: unknown): string => {\n  let message: string\n\n  if (error instanceof Error) {\n    message = error.message;\n  } else if (error && typeof error === 'object' && 'message' in error) {\n    message = String(error.message);\n  } else if (typeof error === 'string') {\n    message = error;\n  } else {\n    message = 'An unknown error occurred';\n  }\n\n  return message;\n}\n```\n\nNow you can log the error message to the console, send it to your error tracking service, save it to MongoDB, or handle it in any way you prefer, while returning a user-friendly message to the user.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this post, we explored Next.js form handling, covering HTML validation, input resets with useActionState, and efficient server-side validation.","src/content/blog/nextjs-form-handling.md","318829f414d77f5b",{"html":199,"metadata":200},"\u003Cp>Let’s explore how to handle form management in Next.js, from HTML form validation to managing input resets with useActionState, and efficiently implementing server-side validations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"html-form-validation\">HTML Form Validation\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>To begin, we’ll look at how we can validate forms using HTML validation, which is a straightforward way to ensure form inputs meet certain criteria without needing JavaScript.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But first, let’s start with the Next.js home page.
