No problem.\n\nIf your template doesn’t include a blog by default, you'll need to set things up manually. That means creating your own CMS items from scratch, but don’t worry, it’s simpler than it sounds.\n\nIn this quick guide, I’ll walk you through how to add a blog to any Framer site, even if your starting point is completely empty.\n\n![Framer add blog button](/media/blog/how-to-add-a-blog-to-your-framer-project/1.webp)\n\nWe’re starting with a blank canvas.\nHead over to the CMS panel and click “Add Blog.”\nFramer will automatically create two collections for you:\none for your blog posts, and one for blog categories.\n\n## Why Are Categories and Blog Posts Stored Separately?\n\nWhen building a blog or CMS, you’ll often see that categories and blog posts are managed as separate collections. Here’s why:\n\n### Better Organization & Reusability  \nCategories act like labels or folders for your posts. By keeping them separate, you can easily add, edit, or remove categories without touching individual blog posts.  \nThis means if you want to rename or restructure a category, you do it once, and all posts under that category update automatically.\n\n### Faster Queries & Performance  \nSeparating categories allows the system to fetch posts and categories independently.  \nFor example, when showing a list of categories, the CMS doesn’t have to scan through every post, improving speed and scalability.\n\n### Cleaner Data Structure  \nPosts contain their own content, metadata, images, and links. Categories are simpler objects with just a name and maybe a description or slug.  \nSeparating these keeps your database or content files cleaner and easier to maintain.\n\n### More Flexibility in Design & Filtering  \nSince categories are their own entities, you can build dynamic filters, menus, or tag clouds that update based on category data, without needing to parse through posts every time.\n\nAnd now we get 4 categories and 5 blog posts\n\n![Blog posts and categories created for us by Framer](/media/blog/how-to-add-a-blog-to-your-framer-project/2.webp)\n\nNow, if we click **Back**, we can see this:\n\n![Framer left menu showing the pages list](/media/blog/how-to-add-a-blog-to-your-framer-project/3.webp)\n\n## After Creating the Blog\n\nOnce you create your blog CMS collection in Framer, your site structure automatically expands. You get:\n\n- **Home** – Your main landing page, the front door of your site.\n\n- **/blog** – A dynamic CMS route that lists all your articles. This is the URL where all your articles will be shown, for example, `yourdomain.com/blog`.\n\nAnd under `/blog`, you'll see something like:\n\n- **Articles • 5** – This shows you have 5 blog posts in your CMS, each one pulling from your collection.\n\n✅ Clean structure  \n✅ SEO-ready  \n✅ Scalable as hell\n\nNow you're set to start dropping knowledge bombs.\n\n## How to add a blog to a project with the CMS already set up\n\nIf you're using a template or working on a project where the CMS is already set up, you might not see the Add Blog button in the CMS panel. In that case, there's a simple workaround.\n\n![Framer left menu no new blog option](/media/blog/how-to-add-a-blog-to-your-framer-project/16.webp)\n\nGo back to the Framer dashboard, create a new blank project, and follow the same steps to add a blog. Once it's created, you can copy the CMS structure into your main project.\n\n![Framer dashboard new project](/media/blog/how-to-add-a-blog-to-your-framer-project/15.webp)\n\nWith this new blank project open, create a new blog by following the steps from the first section of this post.\n\nNext, head over to the CMS tab.\n\n![Framer dashboard CMS tab](/media/blog/how-to-add-a-blog-to-your-framer-project/5.webp)\n\nIn the CMS tab, right-click **Articles** and choose **Copy**.\n\n![Framer dashboard copy collection](/media/blog/how-to-add-a-blog-to-your-framer-project/4.webp)\n\nGo to the Framer dashboard and open your target project. In my case, I’m using the one from the micro animations tutorial.\n\n![Framer dashboard project](/media/blog/how-to-add-a-blog-to-your-framer-project/19.webp)\n\nIn the CMS tab, right-click anywhere on the left panel (don’t click on any of the collections) and choose Paste.\nCategories will be included automatically, no need to copy them separately.\n\n![Framer dashboard paste collection](/media/blog/how-to-add-a-blog-to-your-framer-project/17.webp)\n\nAs you can see, all the data has been copied from the other project into this one, so you don’t have to waste time setting up all the fields for your Blog or Categories collections.\n\n![Framer dashboard articles and categories collections](/media/blog/how-to-add-a-blog-to-your-framer-project/18.webp)\n\n## ✅ Done. What’s Next?\n\nAs you can see, you just saved a ton of time.\n\nNo rebuilding collections. No messing with field types. No wondering what you forgot.\n\nYou’ve now got a fully functional blog, complete with posts, categories, and a clean URL structure, ready to go.\n\n### This gives you:\n\nA scalable setup you can keep adding to\n\nBetter SEO right out of the gate\n\nLess time fiddling, more time publishing\n\n### Next step? Start writing.\n\nEven if it’s just one article a week, it compounds.\n\nYour blog is now a growth engine.

Here's why:\n\n## 1. Clean and Consistent Data Structure\n\nHere's the deal: When you're pulling data from an API, it's not always in the format you need.\n\nSometimes, APIs return bloated, nested objects with way more information than you care about. \n\nThat's where mapping comes in. \n\nFor instance, let's look at some user data from [https://fakestoreapi.com/](https://fakestoreapi.com/)\n\nWe are gonna get some user data, but mapped it in a way that some of the user data gets lefted out.\n\nWhen you hit this endpoint https://fakestoreapi.com/users you get a list of users with all sorts of info. \nHere's an example of one user object:\n\n```js showLineNumbers\n[\n   {\n      \"address\": {\n         \"geolocation\": {\n            \"lat\": \"-37.3159\",\n            \"long\": \"81.1496\"\n         },\n         \"city\": \"kilcoole\",\n         \"street\": \"new road\",\n         \"number\": 7682,\n         \"zipcode\": \"12926-3874\"\n      },\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"email\": \"john@gmail.com\",\n      \"username\": \"johnd\",\n      \"password\": \"m38rmF$\",\n      \"name\": {\n         \"firstname\": \"john\",\n         \"lastname\": \"doe\"\n      },\n      \"phone\": \"1-570-236-7033\",\n      \"__v\": 0\n   }\n]\n```\n\nLet's define the type of the user\n\n```js showLineNumbers\ntype User = {\n  address: {\n    city: string;\n    street: string;\n    number: number;\n    zipcode: string;\n  };\n  id: number;\n  email: string;\n  username: string;\n  name: {\n    firstname: string;\n    lastname: string;\n  };\n  phone: string;\n};\n```\n\nAnd this is the type for the filtered user. ***USE TYPESCRIPT*** 👈\n\n```js showLineNumbers\ntype FilteredUser = {\n  id: string;\n  email: string;\n  username: string;\n  name: {\n    firstname: string;\n    lastname: string;\n  };\n  address: {\n    city: string;\n    street: string;\n    zipcode: string;\n  };\n};\n```\n\nThis is the function for mapping the user data\n\n```js showLineNumbers\n// Function to filter out unwanted fields\nfunction filterUserData(users: User[]): FilteredUser[] {\n  return users.map(({ id, email, username, name, address }) => ({\n    id: '' + id, // number to string\n    email,\n    username,\n    name: {\n      firstname: name.firstname,\n      lastname: name.lastname,\n    },\n    address: {\n      city: address.city,\n      street: address.street,\n      zipcode: address.zipcode,\n    },\n  }));\n}\n```\n\n## 2. Decoupling\n\nSometimes, APIs change.\n\nWhen that happens, do you want to rewrite your entire app? Nope.\n\nWith mapped data, you're decoupling your app from the API. \n\nIf the API response changes, you just tweak your mapping logic instead of ripping apart \nyour whole codebase.\n\n**Save yourself from a world of pain.**\n\n![You are entering a world of pain - Walter - The big lebowsky](/media/blog/why-mapping-api-data-is-crucial/world-of-pain-walter-min.png)\n\nIf the API changes its response structure or fields, you can adjust the mapping \nlogic rather than **refactoring the entire app**.\n\n## 3. Performance\n\nMore data = more problems. \n\nBy mapping your data, you cut down on the size of the payload you're passing around. \n\nThis boosts performance and makes your app faster.\n\nInstead of dragging around unnecessary fields, just map what you need.\n\n## 4. Error Handling: Catch Errors Before They Wreak Havoc\n\nWhen mapping, you can intercept missing fields or errors in the API response. \n\nThat way, you can fix them before they break your app and ruin the user experience.","src/content/blog/why-mapping-api-data-is-crucial.md","a765d394fb051d5c",{"html":177,"metadata":178},"\u003Cp>Mapping data from an API is an essential step for several reasons,\nespecially when you’re dealing with web development and interacting\nwith third-party services.

Now you want to change it everywhere. Manually updating? Nightmare.\n\nThe problem? You’re repeating yourself because Framer lacks a central system for padding variables. Every change becomes a tedious “find and replace” across your entire design.\n\n#### Solution 1: Spacer Component (No Code Needed)\n\nCreate an invisible Frame component that acts as a spacer with a fixed width or height. Use this instead of padding everywhere. Want to adjust spacing? Change the spacer’s size once, and every instance updates automatically.\n\nUse variants for Desktop, Tablet, and Phone to handle responsiveness.\n\n#### Solution 2: Responsive Padding Code Override (Advanced)\n\nAdd code overrides that read padding values from global `window` variables. Change the value in the `window` object once, and the padding updates instantly on the linked element across your project.\n\nDon’t worry if you can’t code, I’ll explain every step, and ChatGPT’s got your back.\n\nThis way you save time, avoid errors, and keep your designs consistent without hunting down every padding instance.\n\n## Solution 1: Spacer Component (No Code Needed)\n\nI want to centralize the padding of my Sections, so when I want to change it in the rest of my pages, and for every breakpoint, I only have to do it once.\n\n### Step 1: Create a Spacer Component (Visual Padding Control)\n\n![](/media/blog/framer-padding-hack-update-spacing-project/2025-08-11-16-27-56-image.webp)\n\n- Make a new **empty Frame** component called `Spacer`.\n\n- Set its default width (or height) to whatever base spacing you want.\n\n- No background color, no border, just an invisible box.\n\n- Save it as a reusable component.\n\n> **Pro tip:** Use different Spacer variants for horizontal and vertical spacing if you want, name them Desktop, Tablet and \n\n## Step 2: Use Spacer Components Instead of Padding\n\n- Wherever you want padding inside your layouts or components, **drag in your `Spacer` component**.\n\n- For horizontal padding, place Spacer frames on left/right edges.\n\n- For vertical padding, place Spacer frames on top/bottom edges.\n\n- Now, adjusting padding means **editing the Spacer component’s width or height once**, and it updates everywhere.\n  \n  Here you can see it in action: my Section is a stack with side-by-side elements, no padding or gap.\n\n![](/media/blog/framer-padding-hack-update-spacing-project/2025-08-11-16-39-36-image.webp)\n\nI made the spacer components blue so you can see them clearly.\n\n![](/media/blog/framer-padding-hack-update-spacing-project/2025-08-11-16-40-20-image.webp)\n\nHere are the values for the Spacers.\n\n![](/media/blog/framer-padding-hack-update-spacing-project/2025-08-11-18-46-10-image.webp)\n\nFor each breakpoint, simply switch to the respective variant: Tablet or Phone.\n\n![](/media/blog/framer-padding-hack-update-spacing-project/2025-08-11-16-50-38-image.webp)\n\n\n\n## Solution 2: Responsive Padding Code Override (Advanced)\n\nNow I'm gonna go to Assets > Code > Add code and create a New Override file for our code override solution.\n\n![](/media/blog/framer-padding-hack-update-spacing-project/2025-08-11-19-42-25-image.webp)\n\n**Now open your file and replace the default code with this:**\n\n```ts\nimport {\n    forwardRef,\n    type ComponentType,\n    useRef,\n    useState,\n    useEffect,\n} from \"react\"\n\nconst MOBILE_WIDTH = 802\nconst TABLET_WIDTH = 1002\n\nconst PADDING = {\n    desktop: 150,\n    tablet: 72,\n    phone: 20,\n}\n\nexport function withResponsivePadding(Component): ComponentType {\n    return forwardRef((props, ref) => {\n        const [padding, setPadding] = useState(PADDING.desktop)\n        const prevBreakpoint = useRef(\"desktop\")\n\n        useEffect(() => {\n            function getBreakpoint(width) {\n                if (width >= TABLET_WIDTH) return \"desktop\"\n                if (width >= MOBILE_WIDTH) return \"tablet\"\n                return \"phone\"\n            }\n\n            function updatePadding() {\n                const width = window.innerWidth\n                const currentBreakpoint = getBreakpoint(width)\n\n                if (currentBreakpoint !== prevBreakpoint.current) {\n                    prevBreakpoint.current = currentBreakpoint\n                    setPadding(PADDING[currentBreakpoint])\n                }\n            }\n\n            updatePadding()\n            window.addEventListener(\"resize\", updatePadding)\n            return () => window.removeEventListener(\"resize\", updatePadding)\n        }, [])\n\n        return (\n            \u003CComponent\n                ref={ref}\n                {...props}\n                style={{\n                    paddingLeft: padding,\n                    paddingRight: padding,\n                }}\n            />\n        )\n    })\n}\n\n```\n\nNow I'm going to select one of my Sections and link a code override to it.\n![](/media/blog/framer-padding-hack-update-spacing-project/2025-08-11-20-00-49-image.webp)\n\n![](/media/blog/framer-padding-hack-update-spacing-project/2025-08-11-20-01-08-image.webp)\n\nCode overrides like this run only in preview or publish mode, Framer’s canvas doesn’t execute override code, so you won’t see the padding changes live inside the editor.\n\nNow you can test it.\n\n### How the Responsive Padding Override Works\n\nThis override dynamically adjusts left and right padding on your component based on the window width.\n\nIt listens to window resize events and updates padding only when crossing defined breakpoints (`desktop`, `tablet`, `phone`) to avoid unnecessary re-renders.\n\n### Key Constants and Variables\n\n```ts\nconst MOBILE_WIDTH = 802;\nconst TABLET_WIDTH = 1002;\n\nconst PADDING = {\n  desktop: 150,\n  tablet: 72,\n  phone: 20,\n};\n```\n\n\n\n- `MOBILE_WIDTH` and `TABLET_WIDTH` define your breakpoint widths in pixels.\n\n- `PADDING` contains the padding values (in pixels) applied at each breakpoint.\n\n### Breakpoint Detection Function\n\n```ts\nfunction getBreakpoint(width) {\n  if (width >= TABLET_WIDTH) return \"desktop\";\n  if (width >= MOBILE_WIDTH) return \"tablet\";\n  return \"phone\";\n}\n```\n\n- Returns a breakpoint name based on the current window width.\n\n- You can customize these breakpoints to fit your design.\n\n### React Hook for Padding Updates\n\n```ts\nconst [padding, setPadding] = useState(PADDING.desktop);\nconst prevBreakpoint = useRef(\"desktop\");\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n  function updatePadding() {\n    const width = window.innerWidth;\n    const currentBreakpoint = getBreakpoint(width);\n\n    if (currentBreakpoint !== prevBreakpoint.current) {\n      prevBreakpoint.current = currentBreakpoint;\n      setPadding(PADDING[currentBreakpoint]);\n    }\n  }\n\n  updatePadding();\n  window.addEventListener(\"resize\", updatePadding);\n  return () => window.removeEventListener(\"resize\", updatePadding);\n}, []);\n```\n\n- Initializes padding state to desktop padding by default.\n\n- Adds a resize event listener that calls `updatePadding` on every window resize.\n\n- Updates the padding state only if the breakpoint changes (avoids redundant updates).\n\n### Applying the Padding Styles\n\n```ts\nreturn (\n  \u003CComponent\n    ref={ref}\n    {...props}\n    style={{\n      paddingLeft: padding,\n      paddingRight: padding,\n    }}\n  />\n);\n```\n\n- The calculated padding is applied inline as `paddingLeft` and `paddingRight` styles on the wrapped component.\n\n- You can add other style properties here if needed.\n\n### How to Customize\n\n- **Change padding values:** Update the numbers inside `PADDING` to control spacing on each device size.\n\n- **Adjust breakpoints:** Modify `MOBILE_WIDTH` and `TABLET_WIDTH` to your preferred pixel widths.\n\n- **Add vertical padding:** Include `paddingTop` and `paddingBottom` in the style object if you want vertical spacing too.\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- This override only works during preview and published mode; the Framer canvas does not run override code.\n\n- If you want visual feedback inside the canvas, consider static styles or placeholder components.\n\nThat’s it, a lean, flexible, responsive padding override you can use to manage horizontal spacing globally with zero extra spacer components.","src/content/blog/framer-padding-hack-update-spacing-project.md","f4a1693a24856a8e",{"html":210,"metadata":211},"\u003Cp>You set padding on dozens of sections and pages in Framer.

In /src/page.tsx, we have the following code:\n\n```jsx\nimport FeedbackForm from \"@/components/feedback-form\";\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    \u003Csection className=\"h-screen w-full flex items-center justify-center bg-yellow-400\">\n      \u003Cdiv className=\"max-w-lg w-full p-6 shadow-md rounded-xl bg-white\">\n        \u003Ch1 className=\"text-2xl font-bold mb-4\">Feedback\u003C/h1>\n        \u003CFeedbackForm />\n      \u003C/div>\n    \u003C/section>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn the /src/components directory, create a new file named feedback-form.tsx:\n\n```jsx\n'use client'\n\nimport React, { useActionState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createFeedbackAction } from '@/actions/create-feedback-action';\nimport { FeedbackState } from '@/types';\nimport toast from 'react-hot-toast';\n\nconst initialState:FeedbackState = {\n  message: '',\n  success: false\n}\n \nfunction FeedbackForm() {\n  const [state, formAction, isPending] = useActionState(createFeedbackAction, initialState)\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!isPending && state?.message) {\n      if (state.success) {\n        toast.success(state.message, {\n          position: 'top-center',\n          duration: 4000,\n        });\n      } else {\n        toast.error(state.message, {\n          position: 'top-center',\n          duration: 4000,\n        });\n      }\n    }\n  }, [isPending, state.message, state.success]);\n\n  return (\n    \u003Cform action={formAction} className=\"space-y-4\">\n      \u003Cdiv className=\"form-control\">\n        \u003Clabel htmlFor=\"email\" className=\"label\">\n          \u003Cspan className=\"label-text\">Email\u003C/span>\n        \u003C/label>\n        \u003Cinput\n          id=\"email\"\n          name=\"email\"\n          type=\"email\"\n          defaultValue={state.formValues?.email || ''}\n          className={`input input-bordered w-full`}\n          minLength={4}\n          maxLength={50}\n        />\n        {state?.errors?.email && (\n          \u003Cspan className=\"text-red-500 text-sm mt-1\">\n            {state?.errors.email[0]}\n          \u003C/span>\n        )}\n      \u003C/div>\n\n      \u003Cdiv className=\"form-control mt-4\">\n        \u003Clabel htmlFor=\"text\" className=\"label\">\n          \u003Cspan className=\"label-text\">Message\u003C/span>\n        \u003C/label>\n        \u003Ctextarea\n          id=\"text\"\n          name=\"text\"\n          defaultValue={state.formValues?.text || ''}\n          rows={4}\n          className=\"textarea textarea-bordered w-full\"\n          minLength={4}\n          maxLength={1000}\n        >\u003C/textarea>\n        {state?.errors?.text && (\n          \u003Cspan className=\"text-red-500 text-sm mt-1\">\n            {state?.errors.text[0]}\n          \u003C/span>\n        )}\n      \u003C/div>\n      \u003Cbutton\n        className=\"btn btn-neutral w-full mt-4\"\n        disabled={isPending}\n      >\n        {isPending ? 'Sending...' : 'Send'}\n      \u003C/button>\n    \u003C/form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Form Component Breakdown: HTML Validation, useEffect, and useActionState\n\nHere’s a detailed look at how the FeedbackForm component manages form handling using HTML validation, useEffect, and useActionState.\n\nInitial State Definition\nThe initialState object sets the baseline for feedback messaging and success status:\n\n```jsx\nconst initialState:FeedbackState = {\n  message: '',\n  success: false\n}\n```\n\nForm State Management with useActionState\nThe useActionState hook manages the form's state and actions:\n\n```jsx\nconst [state, formAction, isPending] = useActionState(createFeedbackAction, initialState)\n```\n\nThis hook helps control the form submission process, tracking whether a submission is pending and updating the state accordingly.\n\nFeedback Display with useEffect\nThe useEffect hook monitors the isPending status and the state object to display success or error messages:\n\n```jsx\nuseEffect(() => {\n  if (!isPending && state?.message) {\n    if (state.success) {\n      toast.success(state.message, {\n        position: 'top-center',\n        duration: 4000,\n      });\n    } else {\n      toast.error(state.message, {\n        position: 'top-center',\n        duration: 4000,\n      });\n    }\n  }\n}, [isPending, state.message, state.success]);\n\nexport default FeedbackForm\n```\n\nThis ensures that users are notified of the outcome after form submission.\n\n### Input Fields with HTML Validation\nThe input fields incorporate basic HTML validation rules using attributes like minLength and maxLength\n\n```jsx\n\u003Cinput\n  id=\"email\"\n  name=\"email\"\n  type=\"email\"\n  defaultValue={state.formValues?.email || ''}\n  className=\"input input-bordered w-full\"\n  minLength={4}\n  maxLength={50}\n/>\n```\n\nThese attributes validate the inputs before the form is submitted.\n\nError Handling for Inputs\nErrors are displayed beneath each input field when validation fails:\n\n```jsx\n{state?.errors?.email && (\n  \u003Cspan className=\"text-red-500 text-sm mt-1\">\n    {state?.errors.email[0]}\n  \u003C/span>\n)}\n```\n\nThe component checks for errors in the state and renders them if present.\n\nSubmit Button Behavior\nThe submit button dynamically reflects the form’s pending state:\n\n```jsx\n\u003Cbutton\n  className=\"btn btn-neutral w-full mt-4\"\n  disabled={isPending}\n>\n  {isPending ? 'Sending...' : 'Send'}\n\u003C/button>\n```\n\nWhen the form is pending, the button displays “Sending…” to indicate the submission process.\n\nThis breakdown showcases how each part of the FeedbackForm component works together to create a smooth form handling experience, leveraging both client-side validation and feedback mechanisms.\n\n## sendFeedbackAction server action\n\nWithin the /src/actions directory, create a new file named send-feedback-action.ts:\n\n```jsx\n'use server'\n\nimport { z } from 'zod' \nimport { connectDB } from \"@/utils/connectDB\"\nimport { FeedbackData, FeedbackState } from '@/types'\nimport { getErrorMessage } from '@/utils/error'\nimport Feedback from \"@/models/feedback\";\n\nexport async function createFeedbackAction(prevState: FeedbackState, formData: FormData) {\n  const schema = z.object({\n    email: z\n      .string()\n      .email({ message: 'Invalid email format' })\n      .nonempty({ message: 'Email is required' })\n      .max(50, { message: 'Email should be at most 50 characters long' }),\n    text: z\n      .string()\n      .min(4, { message: 'Message should be at least 4 characters long' })\n      .nonempty({ message: 'Message is required' })\n      .max(1000, { message: 'Message should be at most 500 characters long' }),\n  })\n  \n  try {\n    const sourceData: FeedbackData = {\n      email: formData.get('email') as string,\n      text: formData.get('text') as string,\n    }\n\n    const validatedFields = schema.safeParse(sourceData);\n\n    if (!validatedFields.success) {\n      return {\n        success: false,\n        message: 'Invalid fields',\n        errors: validatedFields.error.flatten().fieldErrors,\n        formValues: sourceData\n      };\n    }\n    \n    await connectDB()\n\n    await Feedback.create(\n      validatedFields.data\n    )\n\n    return {\n      success: true, \n      message: 'New feedback created' \n    }\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Error sending feedback:\", getErrorMessage(error));\n    return {\n      success: false, \n      message: `We couldn't process your feedback. Please try again later.`\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### sendFeedbackAction Breakdown: Zod Schema Validation and Database Interaction\n\nThe createFeedbackAction function handles form validation and database interactions using Zod schemas and MongoDB.\n\nAs you can see, we extract the error message from the catch block and return a generic error message to the user.\n\ngetErrorMessage(error) is a utility function that extracts the error message from the error object.\n\nThis error is of type unknown by default, it can be a string or an object, so we need to check if it's an object and extract the message property.\n\n```jsx\nexport const getErrorMessage = (error: unknown): string => {\n  let message: string\n\n  if (error instanceof Error) {\n    message = error.message;\n  } else if (error && typeof error === 'object' && 'message' in error) {\n    message = String(error.message);\n  } else if (typeof error === 'string') {\n    message = error;\n  } else {\n    message = 'An unknown error occurred';\n  }\n\n  return message;\n}\n```\n\nNow you can log the error message to the console, send it to your error tracking service, save it to MongoDB, or handle it in any way you prefer, while returning a user-friendly message to the user.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this post, we explored Next.js form handling, covering HTML validation, input resets with useActionState, and efficient server-side validation.","src/content/blog/nextjs-form-handling.md","4127f68f80e0fd0f",{"html":270,"metadata":271},"\u003Cp>Let’s explore how to handle form management in Next.js, from HTML form validation to managing input resets with useActionState, and efficiently implementing server-side validations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"html-form-validation\">HTML Form Validation\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>To begin, we’ll look at how we can validate forms using HTML validation, which is a straightforward way to ensure form inputs meet certain criteria without needing JavaScript.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But first, let’s start with the Next.js home page.

Think of it as a tiny global state container that multiple components or overrides can read from and update.\n\nUsing `createStore` and `useStore` lets you **share state across your entire Framer project**. When one component updates the `background` color, any other component using that same store will instantly reflect the change.\n\nTypically, you place your store in a separate file, like `useStore.ts` when you want to make values available throughout your whole site.\n\nBut you can also define a store within a single file to share data between multiple functions or components locally.\n\n---\n\nIn this case, though, we’re going to use React’s built-in `useState` instead of `useStore`.\n\nWhy? Because **we don’t need to share state between multiple overrides or components here**. The variant we’re switching is only relevant inside this single component.\n\nUsing `useState` keeps things simple and local. It lets us toggle the variant on click without affecting anything else in the app.\n\nSo for controlling a variant within just one override, `useState` is the better fit, lightweight and straightforward.\n\nSo now, let's import useState and delete everything we are not going to need.\n\n```ts\nimport { forwardRef, type ComponentType, useState } from \"react\"\n\nexport function withRotate(Component): ComponentType {\n    return forwardRef((props, ref) => {\n        return (\n            \u003CComponent\n                ref={ref}\n                {...props}\n                animate={{ rotate: 90 }}\n                transition={{ duration: 2 }}\n            />\n        )\n    })\n}\n```\n\nNow I’m going to **refactor** the `withRotate` function, giving it a clearer name and tweaking its behavior to better fit our needs.\n\n```ts\nimport { forwardRef, type ComponentType, useState } from \"react\"\n\nexport function withVariantSwitch(Component): ComponentType {\n    return forwardRef((props, ref) => {\n        const VALID_VARIANTS = [\"Default\", \"Dark\"]\n        const DEFAULT_VARIANT = \"Default\"\n\n        const [variant, setVariant] = useState(DEFAULT_VARIANT)\n\n        const handleClick = () => {\n            const next = variant === \"Dark\" ? \"Default\" : \"Dark\"\n\n            if (VALID_VARIANTS.includes(next)) {\n                setVariant(next)\n            } else {\n                alert(`Invalid variant: ${next}`)\n                setVariant(DEFAULT_VARIANT)\n            }\n        }\n\n        return (\n            \u003CComponent\n                ref={ref}\n                {...props}\n                variant={variant}\n                onClick={handleClick}\n            />\n        )\n    })\n}\n```\n\nThis override lets you switch between variants by clicking the component. It toggles between \"Default\" and \"Dark\", and falls back safely if the value isn't valid.\n\nNow that the `withVariantSwitch` function is ready, we apply it in Framer.\n\nUnder the **Code Overrides** panel:\n\n- Set **File** to `VariantSwitch`\n\n- Set **Override** to `withVariantSwitch`\n\nOnce that’s hooked up, every time you click the component, it’ll switch between the `\"Default\"` and `\"Dark\"` variants.\n\n![](/media/blog/creating-a-simple-counter-in-framer-using-code-overrides/2025-08-04-16-29-20-image.webp)\n\nNo extra props. No extra logic in the canvas. All handled inside the override.\n\n![](/media/blog/creating-a-simple-counter-in-framer-using-code-overrides/2025-08-04-16-31-00-image.webp)\n\n> 💡 **React Tip**: When combining props, **order matters**.  \n> If you're controlling a prop like `variant`, make sure to place it **after** `{...props}` in your JSX:\n\n```ts\nreturn (\n   \u003CComponent\n       ref={ref}\n       {...props}\n       variant={store.count === 0 ? \"Left Disabled\" : \"Left\"}\n       onClick={decrement}\n   />\n)\n```\n\n## Creating the Counter Component (with Code Overrides)\n\nLet's build a counter component and customize its logic with overrides.\n\n![](/media/blog/creating-a-simple-counter-in-framer-using-code-overrides/2025-08-04-19-11-40-image.webp)\n\nWe have a stack that wraps the left and right buttons, and another stack that holds the text `0`.\n\nBelow that, there’s a reset button.![](/media/blog/creating-a-simple-counter-in-framer-using-code-overrides/2025-08-04-19-13-54-image.webp)\n\nCreate a reusable button component with some icons (optional) and support for different variants.![](/media/blog/creating-a-simple-counter-in-framer-using-code-overrides/2025-08-04-19-15-53-image.webp)\n\nGo to `Assets`, duplicate Examples.tsx and name it Counter.tsx\n\n![](/media/blog/creating-a-simple-counter-in-framer-using-code-overrides/2025-08-04-19-19-29-image.webp)\n\nStart with this:\n\n```ts\nimport { forwardRef, type ComponentType } from \"react\"\nimport { createStore } from \"https://framer.com/m/framer/store.js@^1.0.0\"\n\n// Learn more: https://www.framer.com/developers/overrides/\n\nconst useStore = createStore({\n    count: 0,\n})\n```\n\nFirst, we import `forwardRef` from React and `createStore` from Framer. Then we create a shared store with a single value, `count`, starting at 0.\n\nNow we start adding the overrides.\n\n### 1. `withCount`\n\nThis one reads the count from the store and sends it as text to the component.\n\n```ts\nexport function withCount(Component): ComponentType {\n    return forwardRef((props, ref) => {\n        const [store, setStore] = useStore()\n        let count = store.count.toString()\n        return \u003CComponent ref={ref} {...props} text={count} />\n    })\n}\n```\n\nText expects a string, so you have to use toString().\n\nThe number gets updated automatically when the store changes. Simple and reactive.\n\n### 2. `withIncrementClick`\n\nAdds a click handler that increases the count by 1. You click, the store updates, everything else reacts.\n\n```ts\nexport function withIncrementClick(Component): ComponentType {\n    return forwardRef((props, ref) => {\n        const [store, setStore] = useStore()\n\n        const increment = () => {\n            setStore({ count: store.count + 1 })\n        }\n\n        return \u003CComponent ref={ref} {...props} onClick={increment} />\n    })\n}\n```\n\nAttach it with `onClick`.\n\n### 3. `withDecrementClick`\n\nSame idea, but for decreasing. It won’t let the count go below 0. Also changes the button variant when the count is zero.\n\n```ts\nexport function withDecrementClick(Component): ComponentType {\n    return forwardRef((props, ref) => {\n        const [store, setStore] = useStore()\n\n        const decrement = () => {\n            if (store.count > 0) setStore({ count: store.count - 1 })\n        }\n\n        return (\n            \u003CComponent\n                ref={ref}\n                {...props}\n                variant={store.count === 0 ? \"Left Disabled\" : \"Left\"}\n                onClick={decrement}\n            />\n        )\n    })\n}\n```\n\nNice touch for UI feedback.\n\n### 4. `withReset`\n\nResets the count back to 0. Good for starting over. Simple handler.\n\n```ts\nexport function withReset(Component): ComponentType {\n    return forwardRef((props, ref) => {\n        const [store, setStore] = useStore()\n\n        const reset = () => setStore({ count: 0 })\n\n        return \u003CComponent ref={ref} {...props} onClick={reset} />\n    })\n}\n```\n\nNow you have four overrides, each one doing a single job, all connected through the same store. Clean, reactive, scalable.\n\nNow, go back to Home, select the left button component and connect withDecrementClick to it.\n\nApply `withDecrementClick` to the left button, `withIncrementClick` to the right one.\n\n![](/media/blog/creating-a-simple-counter-in-framer-using-code-overrides/2025-08-04-19-28-10-image.webp)\n\nUse `withCount` on the text component to display the current count.\n\n![](/media/blog/creating-a-simple-counter-in-framer-using-code-overrides/2025-08-04-19-29-31-image.webp)\n\nFinally, add `withReset` to the reset button.\n\n![](/media/blog/creating-a-simple-counter-in-framer-using-code-overrides/2025-08-04-19-30-27-image.webp)\n\nThat’s it, every piece is now synced through the same store, no props drilling, no extra state management. Just overrides doing their job.\n\n```ts\nimport { forwardRef, type ComponentType } from \"react\"\nimport { createStore } from \"https://framer.com/m/framer/store.js@^1.0.0\"\n\n// Learn more: https://www.framer.com/developers/overrides/\n\nconst useStore = createStore({\n    count: 0,\n})\n\nexport function withCount(Component): ComponentType {\n    return forwardRef((props, ref) => {\n        const [store, setStore] = useStore()\n        let count = store.count.toString()\n        return \u003CComponent ref={ref} {...props} text={count} />\n    })\n}\n\nexport function withIncrementClick(Component): ComponentType {\n    return forwardRef((props, ref) => {\n        const [store, setStore] = useStore()\n\n        const increment = () => {\n            setStore({ count: store.count + 1 })\n        }\n\n        return \u003CComponent ref={ref} {...props} onClick={increment} />\n    })\n}\n\nexport function withDecrementClick(Component): ComponentType {\n    return forwardRef((props, ref) => {\n        const [store, setStore] = useStore()\n\n        const decrement = () => {\n            if (store.count > 0) setStore({ count: store.count - 1 })\n        }\n\n        return (\n            \u003CComponent\n                ref={ref}\n                {...props}\n                variant={store.count === 0 ? \"Left Disabled\" : \"Left\"}\n                onClick={decrement}\n            />\n        )\n    })\n}\n\nexport function withReset(Component): ComponentType {\n    return forwardRef((props, ref) => {\n        const [store, setStore] = useStore()\n\n        const reset = () => setStore({ count: 0 })\n\n        return \u003CComponent ref={ref} {...props} onClick={reset} />\n    })\n}\n```","src/content/blog/creating-a-simple-counter-in-framer-using-code-overrides.md","4e88580bbc445dc3",{"html":308,"metadata":309},"\u003Cp>Framer’s power shines when you combine design with code.

I landed it after a month, for someone in Israel. A simple mockup for $20.\n\nBut I did not like it much. It was hard to make templates and customize them.\n\nThen I discovered some YouTube videos about Webflow, so I tried learning it with a Udemy course from an instructor named Vako Shvili.\n\n![](/media/blog/framer-and-webflow-took-over-my-client-requests/61250540f4bb236999a00bd3a8ac81567c8f090c.webp)\n\nI never even started half of the Udemy courses I bought.\n\nThere was also Framer. Many designers I follow on X use it because it is no-code, simpler than Webflow, and quite similar. With just a few videos from Framer University and some YouTubers, you can already start building.\n\nI did the same as I had done with Wix: I posted gigs for Webflow and Framer, alongside my WordPress and design gigs.\n\nThen something changed.\n\nOne client asked for Webflow.  \nAnother requested Framer.\n\nMy first paid Webflow gig was for a German site, meetovo.com. \n\nThey initially asked me to integrate Swiper.js, then to create a Figma prototype, a set of dashboards with new features for their HR web app, and finally, to design social media content. I turned down the social media role because I wasn’t comfortable with their style, so I focused solely on the dashboards and the prototype with all the new interactions.\n\nAfter that, I didn’t hear from them again.\n\nBefore long, nobody was asking for WordPress anymore.\n\nI took the opportunity to finally remove all my WordPress gigs, and the agency I worked with stopped sending me WordPress projects as well.\n\nI no longer even offer WordPress as an option.\n\nHere is why I stopped using WordPress and why you might want to do the same. I am not alone either. On forums like Reddit, dozens of other developers are ditching it for the same reasons:\n\n- **They are just faster.** No endless plugin updates, no PHP errors. You can go from idea to live site in hours instead of weeks.\n\n- **Design freedom without the mess.** No fighting against theme templates or WordPress’s outdated block editor. You drag, drop, and tweak until it looks right.\n\n- **No maintenance headaches.** Forget security patches, server migrations, and plugins breaking each other.\n\n- **Better performance out of the box.** Framer and Webflow sites are optimized for speed and SEO from the start.\n\n- **Easier for clients to update.** Clients do not need training. The CMS is visual, not a clunky dashboard full of settings they will never use.\n\n- **Built-in hosting and CDN.** No need to manage hosting providers or set up caching. It is already handled.\n\nAll of these reasons boil down to one simple fact: WordPress adds a lot of unnecessary complexity. Wait until you see the source code of a site built with Elementor, there are extra \u003Ccode>&lt;div&gt;\u003C/code>s everywhere. From bloated HTML full of &lt;div&gt; wrappers to endless plugin conflicts, it slows down development and maintenance. \n\nFramer and Webflow strip all that away, they give you a visual canvas, clean code, and a hosting setup that just works. You focus on building and designing, not wrestling with updates or debugging a broken theme.\n\n**Example: a simple button**\n\n**WordPress (with a page builder like Elementor):**\n\n```html\n\u003Cdiv class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-123 elementor-button-wrapper\">\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"elementor-button-align-wrapper\">\n    \u003Ca href=\"#\" class=\"elementor-button elementor-size-md\">\n      \u003Cspan class=\"elementor-button-content-wrapper\">\n        \u003Cspan class=\"elementor-button-text\">Click Me\u003C/span>\n      \u003C/span>\n    \u003C/a>\n  \u003C/div>\n\u003C/div>\n```\n\nFramer/Webflow equivalent (clean and minimal):\n\n```html\n\u003Ca href=\"#\" class=\"button\">Click Me\u003C/a>\n```\n\nFor developers tired of fighting the WordPress ecosystem, switching to Framer or Webflow simply makes building and maintaining sites easier.\n\n## When SaaS Tools Make Sense\n\nI get why some developers don’t want to use SaaS platforms, some even turn down clients who ask for them.\n\nAs one Redditor put it:\n\n> “We pass on clients who want to use a SaaS platform. They're generally not serious about marketing the site or don’t see the value in having control of the code. Either way, that's not a good fit for us.”\n\nAnd another added:\n\n> “Why work with someone else’s limitations that you’re going to get blamed for? No thanks.”\n\nYes, there can be other problems too. Plans can change, pricing can spike. But for a large portion of the web design market, these tools are a solid alternative to WordPress and they simplify your life.\n\nAnd if things ever go south, you can always migrate to a more code-controlled option like Next.js or Astro.js.\n\n**Happy building.**\n\nThis is Leandro... signing off from the USCSS Sulaco.\n\n![](/media/blog/framer-and-webflow-took-over-my-client-requests/27162653a5fdd69aea9b77c83f14d7975588d0ef.webp)","src/content/blog/framer-and-webflow-took-over-my-client-requests.md","4eb2860bf6974764",{"html":349,"metadata":350},"\u003Cp>For years, almost every project I worked on started the same way.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The design agency would send me the designs or the changes they wanted to make to a site, and I would implement them in WordPress, go through feedback, revisions, and then delivery.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Can you update the header and add a form?” Two hours later, I was still wrestling with a bloated theme, outdated plugins, and a dashboard that looked like it had not been touched since 2012.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The most difficult case was a site where the home page was split into four moving sections.

Wait until you see the source code of a site built with Elementor, there are extra \u003Ccode>&#x3C;div>\u003C/code>s everywhere. From bloated HTML full of &#x3C;div> wrappers to endless plugin conflicts, it slows down development and maintenance.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Framer and Webflow strip all that away, they give you a visual canvas, clean code, and a hosting setup that just works.
